Note:
Here you have different types of workloads: Rails, Hadoop, Chronos for batch jobs, Cassandra and Spark. Now you see what happens when I add or remove services, delete or inactivates machines. Everything is elastic, well almost. There is no standard yet for spawning and deleting machines in response to increasing and decreasing load.
