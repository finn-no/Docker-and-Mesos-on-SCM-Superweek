### docker-swarm

Note:
docker-swarm is a tool for orchestration of multiple hosts.
With this you can set up a cluster of hosts. This is a quite
new tool, so the user experience is a little rough, and it
is not production ready.

A better and more mature and battle tested solution, is called Mesos.
