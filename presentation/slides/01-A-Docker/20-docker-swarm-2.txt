```
```bash
$ docker-machine create --swarm  --swarm-discovery token://bbec8...  ....
```
```bash
$ eval $(docker-machine env --swarm)
```

Note:
First one must run the tool to create a discovery token
Then a swarm master and 1 or more swarm nodes are created with docker-machine
Then we set the environment variables for the cluster so the docker cli can find it

Now, I have cheated and have already created a 3 node cluster on Amazon.

After creating it, it is quite transparent to use. Just use the regular docker cli:

_docker ps_

But docker-swarm is still a little limited, nice to play with and show off in demos,
but far from ready to put in production.

For a better and more mature and battle tested solution, we will look at Mesos.



Batteries included, but removable

What's nice with all these docker tools are that they setup a nice
